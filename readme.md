# graphDB_neo4j_disease_gene_mining

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use Neo4j, a graph database management system, with Python to create a disease gene graph database. The database contains information about the relationship between diseases and genes associated with them.


# Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Neo4j

# Installation
pip install jupyter

# run code
jupyter notebook

The notebook contains step-by-step instructions on how to create a disease gene graph database using Neo4j and Python. You will learn how to:

Connect to the Neo4j database using the neo4j package
Create nodes and relationships in the graph database
Import data from a CSV/TSV file into the database
Query the database to retrieve information about diseases and associated genes
Visualize the graph using the plotly package
The notebook also contains exercises that you can complete to test your knowledge.
